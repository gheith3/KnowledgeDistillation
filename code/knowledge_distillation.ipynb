        "\n",
        "The values for the global parameters in this experiment are chosen based on a combination of common practices in the computer vision literature and the specific requirements of our models and dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`SEED = 42`**: We set a fixed random seed to ensure that our experiments are **reproducible**. The specific number is arbitrary, but fixing it guarantees that anyone running this code will get the exact same random weight initializations and data shuffling, leading to the same results.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`BATCH_SIZE = 128`**: This batch size is chosen to maximize GPU utilization while fitting in memory. It is a power of 2, which is computationally efficient on GPU hardware. This value provides a good balance between accurate gradient estimation and the memory capacity of modern GPUs like the Tesla P100.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`NUM_EPOCHS = 200`**: This value provides sufficient training time for the models to converge on the CIFAR-100 dataset. It allows the models to fully adapt to the data distribution. Training all 200 epochs in a single session requires approximately 8-12 hours on a modern GPU.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`LEARNING_RATE = 0.001`**: This is a standard and robust starting learning rate for the `AdamW` optimizer, which is known to perform well across a wide range of tasks when training from scratch. We use a cosine annealing learning rate scheduler to adjust this rate over time for better convergence.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`LEARNING_RATE_FINETUNE = 0.0001`**: When fine-tuning pre-trained models (like our teacher model with ImageNet weights), we use a 10x smaller learning rate. This prevents the model from \"forgetting\" its pre-learned features and allows for gentle adaptation to the new dataset. Using the same learning rate as training from scratch would cause gradient explosion and model collapse.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`TEMPERATURE = 4.0`**: This is a commonly used value in the knowledge distillation literature. It provides a moderate level of \"softening\" to the teacher's outputs, which has been shown to be effective for transferring knowledge without making the distribution too flat.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`ALPHA = 0.7`**: This weighting factor gives more importance to the distillation loss (from the teacher) than the cross-entropy loss (from the true labels). This is a common strategy in knowledge distillation, as the primary goal is to leverage the rich \"dark knowledge\" from the teacher model. Our ablation study investigates the effect of this parameter more deeply.\n"

        "\n",
        "- **Temperature (T):** This parameter softens the probability distribution of the teacher's outputs. A `T=1` represents the standard softmax with no softening. Higher values increase the influence of the teacher's \"dark knowledge.\" We chose `[2, 4, 6]` to explore a range from moderate to significant softening. `T=4` is a commonly used value in literature, providing a strong baseline, while `T=2` and `T=6` allow us to observe the sensitivity of the model to less and more aggressive softening.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Alpha (α):** This parameter balances the influence of the distillation loss (learning from the teacher) and the cross-entropy loss (learning from the ground-truth labels). The total loss is `α * L_KD + (1 - α) * L_CE`. A higher `α` means we trust the teacher more. We chose `[0.5, 0.7]` to test two common scenarios: an equal balance between the teacher and the hard labels (`α=0.5`), and a scenario where the teacher's guidance is given more weight (`α=0.7`). This allows us to understand how much the student should rely on the teacher versus the ground truth for this specific task.\n"
